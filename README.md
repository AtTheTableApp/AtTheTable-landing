# AtTheTableAppWeb

Solving food poverty through creating a community where it is commonplace to help each other. Through the help of this app, families struggling to eat can be invited to eat with families able to host. 

In this application we do not strictly distinguish between haves/ have nots. We aim to remove any of the shame associated with food poverty. Through this anyone can decide to host and anyone can choose to attend.
Build a stronger community where people in food poverty can be helped.
